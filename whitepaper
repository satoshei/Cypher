Let’s take a step back and refresh in memory a definition of a currency first. While we tend to think about currencies in terms of banknotes and coins or dollars and euros, a currency is a unit of storage and account and a means of exсhаnge, i.e. a universally accepted way to obtain goods and services as well as to store and distribute wealth.

Now, a cryptocurrency can be defined as a digital currency relying on encryption to generate new units and confirm the transactions. It has all the functions of the currency with the difference of running outside of a single centralized platform (such as a bank).

Here is a list of the most significant advantages: Eliminating fraud risks — cryptocurrency is impossible to counterfeit and no party can reverse past transactions.

Providing transaction anonymity — customers decide what exactly they want sellers to know about them.

Cutting down operating costs — cryptocurrency is free from the exchange or interest rates, as well as the transaction charges.

Offering immediate transactions — state holidays, business hours or geographic location of the parties don’t affect cryptocurrency.
